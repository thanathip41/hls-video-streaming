# HLS Video Streaming in Node.js

This project shows how to stream HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) videos using Node.js. 
HLS splits the video into small chunks (.ts files) and can encrypt these segments for secure streaming. 
This guide helps you set up a basic Node.js server for streaming and encryption.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thanathip41/hls-video-streaming.git
